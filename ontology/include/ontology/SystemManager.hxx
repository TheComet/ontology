/*!
 * @brief Manages the creation and deletion of systems.
 *
 * The system manager can be retrieved from an instantiated world with
 * World::getSystemManager(). The system manager is responsible for creating,
 * destroying and updating your systems.
 *
 * Systems can be configured to update only a selection of entities based on
 * the requirements of components, and can also be configured to execute before
 * other systems (execution dependencies). See SystemManager::addSystem for
 * more information.
 *
 * @note SystemManager supports chaining and the programmer is encouraged to
 * use this feature. The following demonstrates the recommended syntax:
 * @code
 * // creates and registers some systems with our world
 * world.getSystemManager().addSystem<MainLoop>()
 *     .suppportsComponents<
 *         Ontology::None>());
 * world.getSystemManager().addSystem<MovementSystem>()
 *     .supportsComponents<
 *             Position,
 *             Velocity>()
 *     .executeAfter<
 *             CollisionSystem>());
 * world.getSystemManager().addSystem<CollisionSystem>()
 *     .supportsComponents<
 *             Position>());
 *
 * // initialises all systems
 * world.getSystemManager().initialise();
 * @endcode
 * Here, **MainLoop** will not receive any entities at all because
 * Ontology::None was declared. **MovementSystem** will only receive entities that
 * have a Position and Velocity. **CollisionSystem* will only receive entities that
 * have a Position.
 *
 * Also note the use of **executesAfter()**, which guarantees
 * CollisionSystem to be executed **before** MovementSystem.
 *
 * @note Make sure to call SystemManager::initialise() after adding all of your
 * systems.
